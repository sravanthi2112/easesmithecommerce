### Challenges Faced

Pagination

Implementing product pagination in a dynamic and user-friendly way was challenging. Initially, loading all products at once caused performance issues, so I implemented a "Load More" feature to fetch products in batches.


### Approach
I started by designing the overall layout and navigation, then implemented product listing and pagination features. followed by adding modals and routing. The frontend is built using React.js, and for managing the cart state, I used React hooks.

For deployment, I used Vercel for the frontend, which allows continuous deployment from the GitHub repository.
